Gang of Four. Design Patterns.

3 major patterns: Creational patterns; Structural patterns; and Behavioral patterns.

1. Creational patterns.
These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

2. Structural patterns.
These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

3. Behavioral patterns.
These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
